## Vaults
`VaultV1.sol` is the core contract in charge of managing strategies involved in generating yield for the Tracer protocol.

The Vault sends funds to a Strategy which must be set using `setStrategy` after deploying a vault.
To interact with the Vault, the caller must be whitelisted. Only governance can add addresses to the `whitelist` mapping.
Vault Deposits and withdrawals must come from an address in this `whitelist` mapping.
On successful deposit, funds are sent to the `strategy` in the same transaction, users recieve `shares` in return.
### Withdraw Process
#### V1 Withdraw Process
The V1 withdraw process has been reduced to its simplest form.

The following are the steps
- A user requests a withdraw with the vault. This increases their pending withdraw limit as well as the `totalRequestedWithdraws`. This user is unable to withdraw for 24 hours.
- the strategy has 24 hours in which these funds should be liquidated. This will increase the `withdrawable` amount of the strategy.
- The user is then able to withdraw 24 hours later. If funds are not available on hand this withdraw will revert.

## Strategies
Strategy contract recieves funds from the Vault after a successful deposit.
Returning funds to the vault must be conducted using the `returnAsset` function, ensuring correct accounting in the vault.
